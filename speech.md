Budget Speech

Mr Speaker,
I move that the Appropriation (2013/14 Estimates) Bill be now read a second time.

It's my privilege to deliver the National-led Government's fifth Budget.

When I stood up to deliver the Government's first Budget, in 2009, New Zealand faced
challenges I think we're only able to fully appreciate with the passing of time.

The world had entered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, from which it
has yet to fully emerge.

The New Zealand economy had been in recession for more than a year and some
economists were predicting the unemployment rate would go higher than 10 per cent.

The previous government had increased its spending by 50 per cent over the previous five
years and that was simply unaffordable.

The Treasury told us that if we kept the policy settings we inherited, we'd never see
another budget surplus again and government debt would increase to levels we're
currently seeing in Europe.

That wasn't the end of it. Few at that time anticipated how difficult the global recovery
would be. And no-one anticipated the Canterbury earthquakes which, apart from the
terrible loss of life, have been one of the most expensive natural disasters in history.

So, starting in Budget 2009, we set out our plan to get New Zealand out of a deep hole.

We were prepared to run deficits for a few years, to support the fragile economy, preserve
jobs and protect the most vulnerable New Zealanders, including families with children,
from the worst of the recession. That meant increasing government debt.

But at the same time, we set out a credible path back to surplus and a plan to start paying
back this debt.

That plan involved reining in expenses and getting on top of the longer-term drivers of
government spending.

We also set out a comprehensive programme to build a more productive and competitive
economy that supports higher incomes and more jobs.


This has included our tax package in 2010, our on-going resource management reforms,
the introduction of 90-day trials, investment in infrastructure, building on our international
trade deals, and a significant investment in skills, training and apprenticeships.

We have been driving for better results from public services. And, since the earthquakes,
we have been working hard to support Cantabrians through the aftermath of their disaster
and through the rebuilding of their city.


Mr Speaker,
The Government's plan has not involved radical change. We've done what we said we
would do, and we've taken people with us.

And that plan â€“ using sound and proven economic policies â€“ is working, as international
bodies like the IMF have recognised.

New Zealanders can look to the future with well-earned confidence and optimism.

The New Zealand economy grew 3 per cent last year, which is almost the same as
Australia, and higher than almost every other developed country.

Wages are growing, cost of living increases have been modest and interest rates are at
50-year lows.

There are 50,000 more jobs in the economy than two years ago, although unemployment
does remain too high and attracting new investment that creates jobs is a particular focus
for the Government.

The fiscal outlook has improved markedly as a result of the Government's sound
management and we are on track to post a surplus in 2014/15.

These are real achievements that are benefitting New Zealanders and their families.

Budget 2013 is about building momentum in this programme.

But there is a risk that all the gains we are now making could be lost in the future, by
going back to policies that have failed in the past.

We know what these are â€“ high and wasteful government spending, more costs and more
taxes on households and businesses, and more state control of the economy that chills
private sector investment and destroys jobs and growth.

New Zealanders were conditioned in the 2000s to believe that Budgets should be about
the novelty of new, expensive spending programmes that held out promises of economic
and social transformation, arranged by the Government.

Those promises were illusory. There was no sustainable revenue stream to pay for the
increased spending, and there was nothing genuinely transformational to show for it.

In contrast, this Government believes that Budgets are about careful stewardship of public
money, and investing wisely in programmes to improve people's lives and help grow the
economy.

In the end, it is the effective use of public money, not the amount of it, that makes a
positive difference to the lives of New Zealanders and their families.


Mr Speaker,
The Government has four priorities this term:

- responsibly managing its finances;
- building a more productive and competitive economy;
- delivering better public services; and
- supporting the rebuilding of Christchurch.


Across our programme, we are working constructively with the ACT, United Future and
Māori parties, and I want to acknowledge their support and assistance.

I intend to talk about each of the Government's four priorities in turn. But first I want to
summarise the economic outlook for the next few years.

The Budget forecasts show annual growth of between 2 and 3 per cent over the next four
years.

These forecasts include the impact of the recent drought, which is expected to reduce
economic activity by 0.7 percentage points in 2013.

Low interest rates, increased activity resulting from the Canterbury rebuild, and strong
commodity export prices will all contribute to growth. And across the Asia Pacific region,
growing numbers of consumers will be demanding the goods and services New Zealand
produces.

The New Zealand economy is expected to grow more strongly over the next two years
than many other developed economies, including the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Japan, and the Euro area.

Budget forecasts also show an improved outlook for jobs and for wage growth. As a
result, household disposable income is forecast to rise by almost 20 per cent over the next
four years.

The current account deficit is forecast to rise gradually to over 6 per cent of GDP in the
next few years, driven by stronger investment by businesses and households, including
investment in the Canterbury rebuild. If investment in the rebuild is excluded, the current
account deficit remains below 5 per cent of GDP.

New Zealand's net offshore liabilities will worsen slightly as insurance pay-outs for
Canterbury continue. However, national saving is expected to rise, led by the Government
getting its finances in order. Household saving rates are expected to retain the gains
made over recent years, following the large dissaving over much of the 2000s.

In summary, New Zealand is well placed.

However, a number of risks and challenges remain. The recent drought, for example, may
have a more persistent effect than expected, and rapid house price growth, if sustained,

Internationally, risks for the global economy appear to have receded over recent months,
although global conditions continue to place upward pressure on the New Zealand dollar.

Budget decisions have been made with this economic context in mind.


Mr Speaker,
I want to talk now about the first of the Government's four priorities, which is to
responsibly manage the Government's finances.

The Budget shows that the Government is on track to meet its two key fiscal targets.

We are on track to get back to surplus by 2014/15.

And we are on track to reduce government debt to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.

Budget forecasts show an operating surplus before gains and losses of $75 million in
2014/15.

We are achieving this while still spending $5.1 billion on new initiatives in the current year
and over the next four years in Budget 2013 â€“ funded, in part, by reprioritising existing
spending.

A surplus is forecast because tax revenue is picking up and the Government is continuing
to restrict growth in expenses. Core Crown expenses are forecast to drop below
31 per cent of GDP in 2014/15 â€“ down from 35 per cent of GDP just two years ago â€“ and
then remain well under that level.

The Government's return to operating surplus is not dependent on the Mighty River Power
share sale. The share offer programme effectively swaps one type of asset for another â€“
electricity company shares for cash â€“ so its primary effect is on the mix of assets and debt
that the Government owns, rather than on the operating balance.

Budget forecasts also show net core Crown debt peaking at 28.7 per cent of GDP in
2014/15 and declining thereafter. Longer-term projections show net debt dropping to
17.6 per cent of GDP by 2020/21, in line with the Government's target.

This is a remarkable turnaround in the books. Projections in Budget 2009, for example,
showed that if the Government had maintained the spending track it inherited, and hadn't
made policy changes, net debt would exceed 60 per cent of GDP by the early 2020s.

But I would remind everyone that forecasts and projections are, by definition, about the
future. While the fiscal outlook has improved markedly over the last few years, a lot of
work is needed to make the forecasts a reality, particularly when it comes to reducing
debt.

Taking on more debt has been appropriate to support the economy and cushion
New Zealanders and their families from a number of major shocks including the recession,
the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes. And, as a percentage of
New Zealand's GDP, our level of debt is still well below most of the countries we typically
compare ourselves with.


4

 But, in dollar terms, net government debt is still rising by around $130 million a week and
is expected to reach $70 billion in 2016/17, which is the equivalent of around $15,000 for
each and every New Zealander.

As households around the country know, carrying substantial debt is neither comfortable
nor financially prudent. Annual interest payments on our debt will this year cost about as
much as spending on the Police, early childhood education and the Unemployment
Benefit combined.

A sizeable debt also risks keeping interest rates and the exchange rate higher than they
would otherwise be, and in turn crowding out the internationally-competitive sectors of the
economy.

So the Government is firmly focused on capping, then reducing, its debt.

And, alongside debt reduction, future surpluses will also give us more choices. These
choices will include, for example, investing in public services, reducing costs on
businesses, and helping families get ahead.


Mr Speaker,
Three key changes have been made to the Government's fiscal parameters.

First, the operating allowances for new spending have been slightly adjusted.

The operating allowance is $900 million in Budget 2013, compared with the $800 million
signalled in the most recent Budget Policy Statement, and will be $1 billion in Budget
2014, compared with $1.2 billion in the BPS. From 2015 onwards, operating allowances
will grow by 2 per cent per Budget.

This change to future allowances will mean bigger surpluses and a greater ability to pay
down debt.

In addition, new capital spending in this and the next three Budgets will continue to be
funded from the Crown's balance sheet, including from the proceeds of the Government's
share offer programme.

Second, the Government intends to delay contributions to the New Zealand
Superannuation Fund until the long-term debt target is reached â€“ that is, until net debt is
no higher than 20 per cent of GDP.

This means Super Fund contributions are now expected to resume in 2020/21. This is two
years later than was projected in the most recent Half Year Update, but is the same time
as was expected when contributions were initially suspended in Budget 2009.

I want to stress that this change in no way affects New Zealanders' entitlement to
New Zealand Superannuation, either now or in the future.

The choice for the Government is whether to use future cash surpluses to reduce debt to
more prudent levels, or whether to put money into world sharemarkets while holding
higher debt. The first option is clearly more responsible.

Third, and finally, the Government is now satisfied there is scope for significant reductions

I will outline these proposed changes in a moment. The impact on the Government's
books, however, is to reduce total Crown revenue, and therefore the total Crown operating
balance. This has already been built into the Budget forecasts.


Mr Speaker,
I now want to turn to the second of the Government's priorities, which is to build a more
productive and competitive economy that supports higher incomes and more jobs.

The Government's plan for building a more productive economy is set out in the Business
Growth Agenda.

This focuses on six key elements that businesses need to grow: access to export markets,
innovation, infrastructure, skilled and safe workplaces, natural resources, and capital
markets.

Each of these areas involves government investment and regulation, and with regard to
the second of these I acknowledge, in particular, the contribution of Regulatory Reform
Minister, and ACT Party leader, John Banks.

The Budget adds a number of new initiatives to the Government's existing agenda.

In particular, the Budget contains a $100 million-a-year internationally-focused growth
package.

This growth package acknowledges New Zealand's need to pay its way in the world
through increased trade and investment, which in turn creates jobs and opportunities for
New Zealanders.

The largest part of the package is a $200 million boost in funding, over four years, for
science, innovation and research.

This extra funding will be invested in expanding current business R&D grants, as well as
establishing a new repayable grant for start-up businesses to assist them to become
investment-ready. There is also new funding for the National Science Challenges and the
Marsden Fund.

The internationally-focused growth package also provides a significant boost for tourism,
as the Prime Minister recently announced.

The Government will invest $158 million over four years to attract more visitors to
New Zealand, particularly high-spending visitors. This includes funding to attract high-end
visitors from emerging markets and funding to attract international business events to
New Zealand.

The growth package also includes additional funding of $40 million over four years to
market and promote New Zealand's international education sector, which already
contributes more than $2 billion to our economy each year.


Mr Speaker,
When the Government took office in 2008, we were confronted with significant financial
problems at ACC and we took action to rebuild its long-term sustainability.


6

 The Government is now satisfied there is scope for significant and sustainable reductions
in ACC levies.

We have therefore made an allowance for levy reductions of around $300 million in
2014/15. Final figures will be determined after ACC consults on levies later this year.

ACC's improved performance, and an on-going review of its funding policy, mean the
Government has also allowed for levy reductions to increase to around $1 billion in
2015/16.

When combined with the $630 million reduction in levies in 2012/13, these proposed
changes amount to around 40 per cent lower ACC levy rates for households and
businesses.


Mr Speaker,
The Budget also confirms a number of revenue measures, and I want to thank Revenue
Minister, and United Future leader, Peter Dunne for his work in this area.

These measures include proposals to let loss-making start-up businesses claim tax losses
on R&D expenditure, together with proposals allowing tax deductibility for certain types of
â€˜black hole' expenditure.

Changes to thin capitalisation rules will help to ensure that multinational companies
investing in New Zealand contribute their fair share of tax.

And Inland Revenue will receive additional funding of $7 million a year so it can better
pursue tax compliance in the area of property investments. This is expected to return
about $45 million a year in additional tax revenue.


Mr Speaker,
Proceeds from the Government's share offer programme â€“ including from the Mighty
River Power float last week â€“ are being placed in the Future Investment Fund, and will be
used to pay for new public assets.

The Budget confirms another $1.5 billion of investment from the Fund.

$426 million will be invested in redeveloping Christchurch and Burwood Hospitals which,
as previously announced, will be the biggest building project in the history of
New Zealand's public health system.

Contingencies totalling over $700 million have been set aside for key projects that include
new, modern schools, Christchurch's justice and emergency services precinct, and
Canterbury tertiary education institutes.

The rest of the $1.5 billion investment includes $50 million for school network upgrades,
$94 million for the fourth year of KiwiRail's turnaround plan, and $80 million for irrigation
infrastructure.

Overall, across multiple Budgets, the Government intends to spend a total of $1 billion
from the Future Investment Fund on 21st Century schools and classrooms, and $1 billion
on priority health investments.



Mr Speaker,
Investing in hospitals, schools and other public assets depends on money coming into the
Future Investment Fund through further share offers.

Today I can announce that Meridian Energy will be the next company to be prepared for a
partial share offer in the second half of 2013.

As with Mighty River Power, New Zealanders will be at the front of the queue for shares in
Meridian and we will be targeting widespread New Zealand ownership.

The Government's share offer programme remains important for the Government's books
and for the economy.

As well as raising money to invest in new public assets, it benefits the companies
themselves through greater market discipline. In addition, the share offer programme
gives New Zealand savers the opportunity to invest in large, New Zealand businesses.


Mr Speaker,
Housing can be made more affordable in New Zealand by focusing on the key areas that
actually make a difference: land supply, consent processes, provision of infrastructure,
and productivity in the construction sector.

The Government is working with councils on these issues, because the decisions they
make about housing affect the entire economy. High housing costs affect financial stability
and create an increased demand for housing assistance.

Today we are introducing legislation to speed up the provision of new housing in areas
where the pressure is greatest and housing is least affordable.

Special housing areas will be designated under accords between the Government and
councils. Council approvals for new housing in those areas can then be managed under a
streamlined process.

This legislation, which will apply for three years, is an immediate response to housing
pressures in areas facing severe affordability problems.

It gives time for the Government's resource management changes to bear fruit, and
address land and housing supply issues in the longer term.


Mr Speaker,
Alongside the Budget, the Government is confirming measures to help ensure
New Zealand's financial stability.

Earlier this week, the Reserve Bank Governor and I signed a memorandum of
understanding that gives the Reserve Bank the ability to require banks to:
ï‚· hold additional capital on their balance sheet as a buffer during an economy-wide credit
boom;
ï‚· hold additional capital against loans in specific sectors if risks emerge in those sectors;

8

 ï‚· use more stable sources of funding to avoid short-term funding shortages; and
ï‚· restrict high loan-to-value ratio lending in the housing sector.

These measures will be available â€“ if required â€“ to help protect the economy and the
financial system from boom and bust cycles.


Mr Speaker,
The Government's third priority for this term is delivering better public services within tight
fiscal constraints.

Spending restraint is not a handbrake on providing better public services. In fact, big
increases in spending have often been a measure of failure, rather than a measure of
success.

Our approach has been to spend well, not to spend up.

The Government's spending increases have been modest and focused on programmes
that will achieve results and improve the lives of New Zealanders and their families.

Last year, the Prime Minister set 10 challenging results for the public sector to achieve
over the next few years, in areas such as reducing long-term welfare dependency,
supporting vulnerable children, boosting skills and employment and reducing crime.

These results span the public sector and the Budget contributes to meeting all of them.


Mr Speaker,
I want to start with the Government's support for vulnerable children and families. This is
already very substantial, with billions of dollars spent on income support, as well as
targeted support for families with complex needs.

The Ministerial Committee on Poverty was established under the confidence and supply
agreement between the National and Māori parties, and I want to acknowledge my fellow
Minister and Māori Party co-leader, Tariana Turia, for her support.

The Budget confirms several important initiatives in this area.

Funding of $100 million over three years has been provided for the Healthy Homes
insulation programme, targeting low-income households with children or high health
needs. The extended programme is expected to insulate around 46,000 additional
houses.

More than $21 million has been provided over the next four years for rheumatic fever
prevention.

Another $1.5 million has been provided next year for budgeting services for low-income
families, on top of the $8.9 million that is already provided.

The Government is also exploring a warrant of fitness programme for social housing, and
will investigate and pilot a low and no interest loan scheme for low-income borrowers.

Some of these initiatives were included in the Children's Commissioner's child poverty


Mr Speaker,
It is widely acknowledged that paid employment is the best way to lift vulnerable families
out of poverty.

That's why the Government is focused on helping those families by creating conditions
where businesses are prepared to invest and to take on new staff. And it's why the
Government's welfare policies have an unrelenting focus on supporting people into work.

The Budget provides $189 million over four years for the next stage of welfare reform.

This includes funding for more intensive case management for people who are able to
work, and means that Work and Income staff will be actively working with over 40 per cent
of beneficiaries.


Mr Speaker,
Despite the Government's $15 billion investment in housing, some people cannot get
social housing assistance when they need it. The provision of social housing is also
dominated by Housing New Zealand, with relatively few other providers.

The Government is therefore announcing three major changes.

First, we will begin developing pathways for New Zealanders in social housing to regain
independence and self-sufficiency in housing as their individual circumstances permit and
as alternatives allow.

Reviewable tenancies, which already apply to some Housing New Zealand tenants, will
then be progressively extended to all social housing tenants.

This will mean people can be in social housing when they have high needs, and for as
long as those needs persist. But they will be given support to move into alternative
housing when their situation improves and they are in a position to take that step to
independence.

This will free up houses for other people and families with high needs, who would
otherwise be shut out of social housing.

The Budget contains funding of $47 million to support this policy, starting in 2015/16.

Second, the Government is increasing its spending on income-related rent subsidies by
$27 million over four years and will make this available as a capped pool to community
housing providers.

Opening income-related rents up to community housing providers puts them on an equal
footing with Housing New Zealand and opens the door for much greater participation in
the social housing sector.

Finally, housing needs assessments will be shifted from Housing New Zealand to the
Ministry of Social Development. This means needs assessments will be independent of
any housing provider, and people seeking different types of government assistance can
get it from one organisation.


10

 
 Mr Speaker,
The Government has made frontline health services a priority, and this is benefitting many
more New Zealanders and their families.

Elective surgery procedures, for example, have increased significantly, emergency room
waiting times have dropped, more MRI and CT scans have been performed and more
children have been immunised.

The Budget continues the Government's focus on better healthcare and prevention.

It includes $1.6 billion over the next four years for new initiatives and to meet cost
pressures and population growth.

$1 billion of that funding, over four years, will go to district health boards to cover
demographic growth and cost pressures. $70 million has been set aside for aged care and
dementia services, $48 million for more elective operations, $36 million for heart disease
and diabetes care, and $25 million for preventative screening services.

The Government is also providing $92 million over four years to pay family members who
care for their disabled adult children.

The additional funding in the Budget takes the total health budget next year to
$14.7 billion.


Mr Speaker,
The Government is helping more New Zealanders get the skills they need to build
successful careers and fulfil their potential.

We are lifting student achievement at all levels of the education system, making more
information available to parents and lifting the quality of teaching and professional
leadership in schools.

We have set ambitious targets for student achievement. In particular, we want to have
98 per cent of school entrants having participated in early childhood education, and
85 per cent of 18-year-olds achieving NCEA Level 2 or equivalent qualification.

The Government's total investment in education will next year increase to over
$9.7 billion.

Over the next four years, the Budget provides new operating funding of $173 million for
early childhood education and $215 million for schools, including nearly $80 million for
operations grants. It also provides $134 million in capital for new school property.

Our particular focus is on supporting children who have too often missed out on
educational opportunities. The Budget therefore provides $41 million to support vulnerable
children to participate in early childhood education and $6 million for a new mentoring
programme to help vulnerable students achieve NCEA Level 2.


Mr Speaker,
The Budget also includes over $130 million of new investment, and reprioritised funding,

Extra funding is provided for Māori and Pasifika trades training, to boost science and
engineering courses, and to increase the proportion of young people with higher-level
qualifications.

The Budget also confirms funding to support the new and expanded apprenticeship
system the Prime Minister announced earlier this year.

The reprioritisation of tertiary funding includes initiatives to increase repayments of
student loans from overseas-based borrowers and reduce defaulting.

The Government is also reining in big rises in student allowance costs by focusing on
younger learners and on people studying for their first degrees. People aged 40 and over
will be restricted to 120 weeks of student allowances, while people aged 65 and over will
no longer be eligible for an allowance.

Students of all ages will continue to have access to the interest-free student loan scheme.

The Budget also invests in expanding the Māori cadetship programme, which will increase
the number of cadets from 250 to 350 each year. I want to acknowledge Māori Affairs
Minister, and Māori Party co-leader, Pita Sharples for his leadership and support in this
area.


Mr Speaker,
Over the last four-and-a-half years, the Government has had a comprehensive
programme of reform to protect communities, prevent crime and put victims first.

This is delivering results.

Reported crime has fallen by almost 17 per cent over the past three years.

And our justice agencies are focused on areas that will get the best results in the future.

The Department of Corrections, for example, is investing $10 million over two years to
reduce offending by prisoners after they are released.

And, as previously announced, the Police are investing more than $160 million over a
number of years to give frontline officers access to new technology such as smartphones
and tablets, which means they can deal with issues on the street without having to return
to the station to do paperwork.


Mr Speaker,
The Government's fourth priority is to support the rebuilding of Christchurch.

Since the first earthquake, almost three years ago, the Government has made it clear that
it will stand beside the people of Canterbury as they rebuild their lives and their
communities.

I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry
Brownlee, and the many public servants, community organisations and families who
continue to work so hard to help each other through the many challenges that remain in
their community.

Considerable progress is being made. The SCIRT Infrastructure alliance has completed
$700 million worth of work, with another $400 million under construction. The demolition of
nearly 1,000 buildings in the Christchurch CBD has almost finished and the cordon will be
removed at the end of June. And, by the end of this month, the Earthquake Commission
will have completed 38,000 repairs and paid out more than $5.3 billion in claims.

The Treasury has recently increased its estimate of total rebuilding costs from $30 billion
to $40 billion â€“ the equivalent of almost 20 per cent of New Zealand's annual GDP.

The Government's share of that total cost will be significant.

On current estimates, around $7.6 billion will be incurred by the Earthquake Commission
and other Crown entities.

Direct government support amounts to another $7.6 billion, making a total Crown
contribution of around $15.2 billion.

Of the Government's direct support, $5.5 billion has already been allocated through the
Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Fund, which was established two years ago and is now
fully committed.

This Budget confirms an additional $2.1 billion of operating and capital spending to further
support the rebuilding of our second-biggest city.

Over $900 million of this funding comes from the Future Investment Fund, for projects
including redeveloping Christchurch hospitals, establishing a justice and emergency
services precinct and supporting tertiary education institutes.

The Government is also investing $300 million in anchor projects for the Christchurch city
centre. And almost $650 million of additional capital funding from departmental balance
sheets will be used for health and education projects in Canterbury.


Mr Speaker,
New Zealand is on the right track.

The Government's books are the envy of most developed countries.

The economy is growing and families are benefitting from that.

The country is seeing the benefit of improved public services that are focused on getting
results.

Things haven't always been easy. But as a nation, we have coped with adversity and
we're now making real progress.

We are seeing the benefits of the Government's programme of sensible, responsible
change.

There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us as a country.

Providing we stick to the plan the Government has set out, I'm confident we will grasp
those opportunities and keep building the brighter future New Zealanders deserve.


Mr Speaker,
I commend this Budget to the House.
